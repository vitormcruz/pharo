"
An RBComment represents a text comment associated with an AST node.

An RBComment is not an AST-Node (not a subclass of program node). But its instances are just wrapping the comment text and (start-) position.

Due to the way the parser handles comments, the RBComment is assigned to its preceding (real) AST node, although we often write the comment prior to a statement.

For example:

foo
""method comment""

self firstStatement.

""comment about the return""
^ self

The ""method comment"" is assigned to the method node, the ""comment about the return"" is assigned
to the ""self firstStatement"" node!

instance variables
	contents 	<String> the comment text
	start	<Number> (start-) position within the method source
